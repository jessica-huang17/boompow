## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was that I was using new languages such as html, css, and javascript. I had some fluency with the syntax since I have had experience in python and C, though some syntax from my known languages do not translate over so that does cause some confusion. It took a while to adjust to the different languages since css is more for styling while html and javascript handles functionality and interface. For example, learning what head, body, div tags represent and do for html. Additionally, in javascript you need to initialize global variables using var and constants using const. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am interested in the backend of web development because I do not have much experience handling APIs and how the functionality of websites work. I would like to learn more about javascript since it is a frequently used language within the domain of web development and in the tech field. I would also like to try other functions besides buttons such as animations. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours, I would have implemented a variety of patterns and made a menu where a player could select difficulties which would dictate what patterns would be selected. Additionally, another interesting feature would be to change the button icons to difference shapes and add more buttons. Adding a hint button to give hints to the user would be another feature that could upgrade the game.
